Breast Cancer Prediction-Using Decision Tree


Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide, Breast cancer is a disease in which cells in the breast grow out of control. There are different kinds of breast cancer. The kind of breast cancer depends on which cells in the breast turn into cancer.

The early diagnosis of Breast cancer can improve the chances of survival significantly, as it can promote timely clinical treatment to patients.Because of its unique advantages in critical features detection from complex BC datasets, machine learning (ML) is widely recognized as the methodology of choice in Breast cancer pattern classification and forecast modelling.

Classification and data mining methods are an effective way to classify data. Especially in medical field, where those methods are widely used in diagnosis and analysis to make decisions.

We will use the UCI Machine Learning Repository for breast cancer dataset.
Attribute Information:

    ID number 2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) 3â€“32)

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

    radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
    texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
    perimeter
    area
    smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
    compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
    concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
    concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
    symmetry
    fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

The mean, standard error and "worst" or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features. For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field 13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.

All feature values are recoded with four significant digits.

Missing attribute values: none

Class distribution: 357 benign, 212 malignant
